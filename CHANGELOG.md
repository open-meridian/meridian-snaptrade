# Changelog

What each release of the SnapTrade plugin changed. Releases before 0.11.0
are described in their commits (`git log`) and the README's "Depends on".

## 0.11.0 (not released)

Contract v14, on open-meridian 0.19.0 (meridian-design
plans/the-custodians-activity-explains-a-break, build 5).

- **The custodian's activity reaches the street.** Each activity on a linked
  account is reported as SnapTrade states it (W2.10): on the account's first
  read in a process, a backfill of every activity SnapTrade holds back to its
  `history_from`; on each read after, the activities that read fetched. The
  street keeps each once by SnapTrade's activity ID, so a restart's backfill
  records nothing twice.
- **SnapTrade's types mapped to the closed list:** `BUY` purchase, `SELL`
  sale, `REI` reinvestment, `DIVIDEND`, `INTEREST`, `FEE`, `TAX`, `SPLIT`,
  `STOCK_DIVIDEND` corporate action, the transfers in and out,
  `CONTRIBUTION`, `WITHDRAWAL`, `JOURNALED` journal; anything else not known,
  with the type as reported. Units signed by what they did to the account; a
  value SnapTrade writes as 0 where none applies sent unset.
- **The instrument:** a held security resolved by its holding's
  identifiers; a plan's own fund code linked by a person resolved as the
  linked symbol, with that person as its provenance; any other code as
  reported. Nothing yet stores a person's link (a plugin cannot save its own
  setting from its page), so a plan's code travels as reported until the
  contract gives a page that way.
- **The sync status carries `history_from`**, the first date SnapTrade's
  history of the account reaches.
- **Raw-record retention covers what was reported:** each reported
  activity's raw record is its own, `activities/<external account>/<activity
  ID>`, kept seven years from receipt (the declared storage), and the Raw
  responses tab opens it by that reference. Each read's records keep
  `raw_retention_days`.
- An activity's `fee` and `fx_rate` are declared as received and not carried,
  and counted as reads see them.
- Synthetic Alpaca has a history: one activity of each kind and an option's
  expiry, on fixed dates from 2025-06-02.
- `make e2e` on core 700d98b's runtime and harness: the street's activity is
  `e2e/expected.activity`, and a new container's backfill records nothing
  twice.
