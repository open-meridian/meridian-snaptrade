# Changelog

What each release of the SnapTrade plugin changed. Releases before 0.11.0
are described in their commits (`git log`) and the README's "Depends on".

## 0.11.0 (not released)

Contract v14, on open-meridian 0.19.0 (meridian-design
plans/the-custodians-activity-explains-a-break, build 5).

- **The custodian's activity reaches the street.** Each activity on a linked
  account is reported as SnapTrade states it (W2.10): on the account's first
  read in a process, a backfill of every activity SnapTrade holds back to its
  `history_from`; on each read after, the activities that read fetched. The
  street keeps each once by SnapTrade's activity ID, so a restart's backfill
  records nothing twice.
- **SnapTrade's types mapped to the closed list:** `BUY` purchase, `SELL`
  sale, `REI` reinvestment, `DIVIDEND`, `INTEREST`, `FEE`, `TAX`, `SPLIT`,
  `STOCK_DIVIDEND` corporate action, the transfers in and out,
  `CONTRIBUTION`, `WITHDRAWAL`, `JOURNALED` journal; anything else not known,
  with the type as reported. Units signed by what they did to the account; a
  value SnapTrade writes as 0 where none applies sent unset.
- **The instrument:** a held security resolved by its holding's
  identifiers; a plan's own fund code linked by a person resolved as the
  linked symbol, with that person as its provenance; any other code as
  reported.
- **The plan-code link** (the product owner's option A, 2026-10-05): the
  table setting `plan_code_links` -- per row an external account, a plan's
  own code and a deployment instrument record -- entered by an admin of the
  plugin in the dashboard's Settings form as an editable typed table. An
  activity under a linked code is that record, naming who changed the row
  and when. The plugin only reads its settings; no page sets one.
- **`activity_retention_days`** (the product owner, 2026-10-05): how long
  each reported activity's raw record is kept, seven years by default, an
  admin of the plugin may set it longer (up to 36,500 days, which the
  storage declaration now asks for) on the dashboard's Settings form; never
  shorter than the history SnapTrade reported, which a shorter value is kept
  to, as the Account links tab says.
- **The sync status carries `history_from`**, the first date SnapTrade's
  history of the account reaches.
- **Raw-record retention covers what was reported:** each reported
  activity's raw record is its own, `activities/<external account>/<activity
  ID>`, kept for `activity_retention_days` from receipt (seven years by
  default), and the Raw responses tab opens it by that reference. Each read's
  records keep `raw_retention_days`.
- An activity's `fee` and `fx_rate` are declared as received and not carried,
  and counted as reads see them.
- Synthetic Alpaca has a history: one activity of each kind and an option's
  expiry, on fixed dates from 2025-06-02; synthetic IBKR a reinvestment
  under a plan's own code (OQKR).
- `make e2e` on core 1d16c52's runtime and harness: the street's activity
  is `e2e/expected.activity`, a new container's backfill records nothing
  twice, and after OQKR is linked to SYNXX's record in the Settings form,
  IBKR's first read reports its reinvestment under OQKR as that record.
